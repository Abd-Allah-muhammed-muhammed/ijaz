## Section 2 — Project Overview

This application is a multi-actor marketplace/platform built around service orders, offers, payments, wallets, guarantor requests, support tickets, jobs, and classified advisements for properties and cars. The route and model layers show these product areas clearly: users create and manage orders, providers receive offers and notifications, both actors can chat, the platform exposes catalog/look-up data, and there are payment flows for order settlement, guarantor requests, and wallet top-ups/withdrawals.

**Main actors:**
- **User:** `App\Models\User`, authenticated in the API by the `user-api` Sanctum guard.
- **Provider:** `App\Models\Provider`, authenticated in provider web sessions and also used in Sanctum-protected API flows.
- **Admin:** `App\Models\Admin`, authenticated through the dashboard session guard.

**Tech stack from manifests:**
- PHP `^8.2`
- Laravel Framework `^13.0`
- Laravel Sanctum `^4.0`
- Inertia Laravel `^3.0`
- React `^19.0.0`
- `@inertiajs/react` `^3.0.2`
- TailwindCSS `^4.1.4`
- Vite `^6.4.2`
- TypeScript `^5.7.2`
- Notable packages: `spatie/laravel-permission`, `spatie/laravel-medialibrary`, `mcamara/laravel-localization`, `mmae/apiresponse`, `paytabscom/laravel_paytabs`, `laravel/reverb`, `laravel/wayfinder`, `ratchet/pawl`, `astrotomic/laravel-translatable`

**Verified app metadata from config/env:**
- App name: `Ijaz`
- Locale: `en`
- Timezone: `UTC`
- Default DB connection in `.env.example`: `sqlite`
- Broadcast driver: `reverb`
- Queue driver: `database`
- Filesystem disk: `public`

## Section 3 — Authentication & Guards

| Guard | Model | Driver | Used By | Token/Session |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `web` | `User` | `session` | `routes/web.php`, `routes/dashboard.php` (admin), `routes/provider.php` | Classic browser session |
| `admin` | `Admin` | `session` | Dashboard routes in `routes/dashboard.php` | Browser session (admin dashboard) |
| `employee` | `Employee` | `session` | Not visibly mounted in analyzed routes | Session auth |
| `provider` | `Provider` | `session` | Provider dashboard routes in `routes/provider.php` | Browser session |
| `user-api` | `User` | `sanctum` | `/api/v1/user/*` routes for login/register/profile/orders | Short-lived Sanctum tokens + ability checks |
| `sanctum` | Generic | `sanctum` | Chats, jobs, guarantor, tickets, wallet, OTP, notifications, advisements | Generic Sanctum tokens; controller code branches on model type |

**Broadcast authentication:**
- `bootstrap/app.php` registers broadcasting auth middleware as `web` + `auth:admin,provider`
- `routes/channels.php` defines private channels: `provider-{id}`, `user-{id}`, `admin-{id}`, `online`, `public`, `systems.{id}`, `chats.{chat}`, `category.{category}`
- `routes/api.php` also registers `Broadcast::routes(['middleware' => ['auth:sanctum']]);`

## Section 5 — Architecture Patterns

### Controller Structure (Thin Controllers Rule)
- Controllers validate input via FormRequest classes
- Controllers call a Service or Action for business logic
- Controllers return responses via `HasApiResponse` trait helpers
- **Rule:** No business logic inside controllers; keep them thin

### Services vs. Actions
- **Services:** Used when logic touches more than one model (e.g., `ChatService`, `FirebaseService`, `TranslationServices`)
- **Actions:** Used for single, self-contained operations (e.g., payment status updates, transaction recording)
- **Directory:** `app/Services/` for services, `app/Actions/` for actions

### Payment Flow
1. User/Provider initiates payment via `/api/v1/*/pay` endpoint
2. Controller calls payment action → creates Payment record → redirects to gateway
3. Gateway calls callback endpoint → status action updates Payment + wallet transactions
4. Real-time notification broadcast via WebSocket

### Real-Time Communication (Reverb)
- Broadcast driver: `reverb` (configured in `config/broadcasting.php`)
- Channel auth in `routes/channels.php`
- Events dispatched from Chat service: `NewMessageEvent`, `ChatUpdatedEvent`, `SupportChatUpdatedEvent`
- Jobs: `NotifyChatMessageReceiver` queued for async notification delivery

### File Uploads
- Spatie MediaLibrary used on: orders, jobs, advisements, guarantor requests
- Manual storage via `store('...')` for other uploads; path persisted in models
- Media routes protected: `/media/file/{media}`, `/media/{media}`, `/media/chat/{media}`

### Translations
- Locale-aware model translation via Astrotomic translatable traits and `withTranslation()` query helpers
- Translation rendering via `TranslationServices::render()`
- Supported locales: en, ar, hi, ur (from `lang/` directory)

## Section 6 — Services & Actions

### Key Services

| Service | File | Purpose | Key Methods |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ChatService` | `app/Services/Chat/ChatService.php` | Orchestrates chat creation, feature selection, online lookup | `generate()`, `order()`, `support()`, `members()`, `onlineUsers()` |
| `FirebaseService` | `app/Services/Firebase/FirebaseService.php` | Sends Firebase push notifications | `message()`, `data()`, `target()`, `toTopic()`, `notify()` |
| `Normalize` | `app/Services/Normalize/Normalize.php` | Normalizes text for search/storage across locales | `make()`, `toString()` |
| `Phone` | `app/Services/Sms/Phone.php` | Formats and validates phone numbers | `make()`, `placeholder()`, `isValid()`, `toString()` |
| `TranslationServices` | `app/Services/Translations/TranslationServices.php` | Renders locale translations into frontend output | `render()`, `getTranslationsFor()` |

### Key Actions

| Action | File | Purpose | Touches |
|---|---|---|---|
| `UpdatePaymentStatus` | `app/Actions/Payment/PayTabs/UpdatePaymentStatus.php` | Maps PayTabs responses to payment updates | Payment model, payment status |
| `ProcessOrder` | `app/Actions/Payment/Order/ProcessOrder.php` | Finalizes order/offer state after payment | Order, OrderOffer models |
| `AddUserTransaction` | `app/Actions/Payment/Order/AddUserTransaction.php` | Records wallet transaction for user | WalletTransaction model |
| `ProcessTopUpRequest` | `app/Actions/Payment/TopUp/ProcessToUpRequest.php` | Finalizes top-up request after payment | TopUpRequest, Wallet models |

---

## Section 7 — Conventions & Rules

### Naming Conventions
- Enums are heavily used for state (e.g., `OrderStatusEnum`, `ProviderStatusEnum`, `PaymentMethodEnum`)
- Resource/controller names mirror model names
- No hardcoded status strings; always use corresponding enum from `app/Enums/`
- FormRequest classes end with `Request` (e.g., `LoginRequest`, `OrderRequest`)
- Resource classes end with `Resource` (e.g., `UserResource`, `OrderResource`)

### API Response Format
- Use `HasApiResponse` trait helpers exclusively: `successResponse()`, `successMessageResponse()`, `successResponseWithToken()`, `failedMessageResponse()`
- Never mix raw `response()->json()` with `HasApiResponse` in the same controller
- Response shapes vary by endpoint; see [docs/API_INVENTORY.md](docs/API_INVENTORY.md) for specific shapes

### Validation
- Always use dedicated `FormRequest` classes; never validate inline in controllers
- Exception: rare cases in API endpoints for simple checks (see `OrderChatController@store`)

### Traits & Reusability
- Core traits live in `app/Traits/` (e.g., `Blockable`, `HasWallet`, `HasOTPs`)
- Traits are mixed into models to add standard behavior
- See [docs/MODELS_REFERENCE.md](docs/MODELS_REFERENCE.md) for trait details

### Database & Migrations
- Many tables are versioned as separate `add_cols_*` migrations rather than single creates
- Polymorphic relationships use `user_id`/`user_type` for flexible actor references
- UUID primary keys on order-related tables; bigint on user/provider tables

### Never Do This
- ❌ Hardcode status strings (use `OrderStatusEnum::New->value`)
- ❌ Use inline validation in controllers (use FormRequest classes)
- ❌ Return raw arrays/models from API endpoints (use Resource classes)
- ❌ Put business logic in controllers
- ❌ Mix raw `response()->json()` with `HasApiResponse` trait calls
- ❌ Create new typos or perpetuate existing ones (`walletTTransactions`, `PropertiyCategory`, `lastMassage`)

## Section 8 — Known Issues Summary

> **Resolved.** Every issue in this section was fixed during the module extraction and
> controller layering work. The original list is archived at
> [docs/archive/REFACTOR_NOTES.md](docs/archive/REFACTOR_NOTES.md) for history.

### Top Priorities (historical)

1. **Order & Guarantee payment/status flows** (High)
   - Controller mixes business rules, fee calculations, payment initiation, and media handling
   - Status transition logic is embedded in controllers instead of services
   - Suggestion: Extract to dedicated services or action classes

2. **Duplicated filtering logic** (Medium)
   - `CarAdvisementController` and `PropertyAdvisementController` duplicate the same filter shape for `index()` and `all()`
   - Suggestion: Move filter logic into shared query scopes or filter classes

3. **Request namespace & model name issues** (Medium)
   - `app/Http/Requests/Api/Api/User/` has duplicated `Api` segment
   - `PropertiyCategory` is misspelled throughout
   - `Conversation::lastMassage` should be `lastMessage`
   - Suggestion: Refactor namespace to `Api/V1/User/`; rename models if cost is acceptable

### Additional Risks
- Response shapes are not uniform across endpoints (wallet/payment endpoints use custom arrays vs. resources elsewhere)
- Chat endpoints use inline validation instead of FormRequest classes
- Notification and account deletion endpoints use `GET` for state-changing operations (should use `PATCH`/`DELETE`)
